      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I've been interested in coding since high school, when I learned to
        build and program robots to sumo fight. After that I started studying
        computer science then focused on communication technology in college.
        Web development feels like a crossroads from my experience and studies.
